      <p>Justin Gerow, based in Chicago, is a prospective website developer who is currently training in the Northwestern University Coding Boot Camp Full Stack Development program.</p>
      
      
      <p>Justin has spent the past 18 years working primarily in the transportation, warehousing, and logistics fields. He started his career in 2000 as a package operations supervisor for a small-parcel company located in Flint, Michigan. Justin spent eight years in this role and during this time also attended the University of Michigan-Flint, where he obtained his Bachelor of Business Administration degree, with a concentration in operations management. In May 2008, he relocated to Irving, Texas, to join a large online retail organization as an area manager in a local fulfillment center. In September 2009, Justin joined a transportation company as a driver business leader based in Gary, Indiana, and in 2014 moved into his current role with the same company, as a sales operations manager based in Chicago. In 2016, he received his Certified Supply Chain Professional (CSCP) certification from APICS, the association for supply chain management.</p>
      
     
      <p>Originally from Michigan, Justin enjoys participating in outdoor activities such as running and hiking in his free time, as well as cooking and exploring Chicago with his girlfriend, Lindsey, and 10-year-old Husky, Link. He also enjoys following auto racing — specifically, rally racing and the European Le Mans Series — and playing the occasional video game on those rainy days. Coding and development is a passion of Justin’s, and he is excited to begin his career in this dynamic and challenging field.</p>
